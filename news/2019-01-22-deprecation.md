This site hasn't been updated in over a year.
Since then a lot of stuff happened in Rust and the WebAssembly world.

The [Rust and WebAssembly working group](https://rustwasm.github.io/) was founded and now provides a lot of tooling, documentation, tutorials and other material.
For a complete introduction to Rust and WebAssembly check out the [Rust ðŸ¦€ and WebAssembly ðŸ•¸ book](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/).
